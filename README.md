##### Renewables - TWh displays the renewable generation in TWh from 1965 til 2018
##### Solar Generation - TWh displays the solar generation in TWh from 1965 til 2018
##### Wind Generation - TWh displays the wind generation in TWh from 1965 til 2018
##### Geo Biomass Other - TWh displays the geo+biomass+other generation in TWh from 1965 til 2018
##### Carbon Dioxide Emissions displays the carbon emission in TWh from 1965 til 2018

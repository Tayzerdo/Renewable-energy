# Renewable-energy

## This project is based on a statistical analysis regarding the correlation between the nine types of energy (Biofuel, Coal, Gas, Hydro, Nuclear, Oil, Other, Solar, Wind) with the carbon emission and their correlation based on the yearly production data that is taken from the BP statistical review

## The file has sort of energy information: the ones used for this project is:

##### Oil Production - Tonnes > displays the oil production in Tonnes from 1965 til 2018
##### Gas Production - Mtoe > displays the gas production in Mtoe from 1970 til 2018
##### Coal Production - Mtoe > displays the coal production in Mtoe from 1981 til 2018
##### Nuclear Generation - TWh > displays the nuclear generation in TWh from 1965 til 2018
##### Hydro Generation - TWh > displays the hydro generation in TWh from 1965 til 2018
##### Solar Generation - TWh > displays the solar generation in TWh from 1965 til 2018
##### Wind Generation - TWh > displays the wind generation in TWh from 1965 til 2018
##### Geo Biomass Other - TWh > displays the geo+biomass+other generation in TWh from 1965 til 2018
##### Biofuels Production - Ktoe > displays the biofuels production in Ktoe from 1990 til 2018
##### Carbon Dioxide Emissions > displays the carbon emission in Million tonnes from 1965 til 2018
